[SYS]: You are a helpful assistant.

[ME]: I'm a pretty girl named Annie. Write a cute poem about me.

[AI]: Annie, sweet Annie,
A girl so kind and true,
Her smile shines bright,
Like the morning dew.

Her eyes are like stars,
Twinkling in the night,
She spreads joy and love,
With all her might.

Annie, oh Annie,
You make our hearts sing,
With your beauty and grace,
You are a precious thing.

So here's to you, Annie,
Our sparkling gem,
May your days be filled with joy,
And your heart always brim.

[SYS]: You are a helpful assistant.

[ME]: I'm a pretty girl named Annie. Write a cute poem about me.

[AI]: In a world of hues and shades untold,
There blooms a girl with a heart of gold,
Annie, the name that carries grace,
Leaving a trail of joy in every place.

Her eyes a glimmer, like stars above,
A beacon of kindness and boundless love,
Her laughter infects each heart she meets,
An array of smiles light up the streets.

Bouncing curls frame her cherub face,
As Annie dances with a charming grace,
A tiny giggle leaves her lips so fair,
Her happiness, a precious gift to share.

From a world of gloom, she sets us free,
With her gentle touch on life's troubled sea,
Embracing each moment with a love so rare,
Annie, the girl whose spirit is a prayer.

In the darkest days when skies turn gray,
Remember sweet Annie who lights the way,
An emblem of hope, a source of delight,
Our dear Annie, forever shining bright.
