#+title: Benchmark CFLAGS

I don't have any benchmark Elisp written here yet. But for now, I can just
discuss my findings. The most fundamental ~CFLAGS~ are
#+begin_src sh
CFLAGS="-Ofast -fno-finite-math-only -fomit-frame-pointer -march=skylake -pipe"
#+end_src

1. ~-ftracer~ makes emacs MUCH slower.
