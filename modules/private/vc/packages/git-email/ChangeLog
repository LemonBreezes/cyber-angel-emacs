* Release 0.2.0
Changes since 0.1.0:

- Four new optional libraries for integration with other packages:

  - ~git-email-gnus~ sets some variables to make ~git-email~ play
    nicely with the Gnus message composition buffer.

  - ~git-email-notmuch~ sets some variables to make ~git-email~ play
    nicely with the notmuch mail client.

  - ~git-email-magit~ adds extra infix arguments to the transient
    command for ~magit-patch-create~ for making it easier to directly
    sending your patches via email.

  - ~git-email-piem~ sets some variables for determining the "to"
    address of a message by reading the ~piem-inboxes~ variable.

- ~git-email~ is now a nix flake, meaning Nix users can easily install
  the package into their environment.

- ~git-email~ now has an Info manual that documents all the options and
   gives some suggestions of the workflow to use.

- The functionality for applying patches was removed in favor of the
  piem[fn:1] packagge
