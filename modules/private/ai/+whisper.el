The output of the ffmpeg command is pretty messy, e.g.
  [AVFoundation indev @ 0x7f867f004580] AVFoundation video devices:
  [AVFoundation indev @ 0x7f867f004580] [0] FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)
  [AVFoundation indev @ 0x7f867f004580] AVFoundation audio devices:
  [AVFoundation indev @ 0x7f867f004580] [0] Cam Link 4K
  [AVFoundation indev @ 0x7f867f004580] [1] MacBook Pro Microphone
so we need to parse it to get the list of devices.
The return value contains two lists, one for video devices and one for audio devices.
Each list contains a list of cons cells, where the car is the device number and the cdr is the device name."
