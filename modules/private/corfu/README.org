* Description :unfold:
This module provides code completion, powered by [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]].

It is recommended to enable either this or [[doom-module:][:completion company]], in case you
desire pre-configured auto-completion. Corfu is much lighter weight and focused,
plus it's built on native Emacs functionality, whereas company is heavy and
highly non-native, but has some extra features and more maturity.

** Module flags
- +icons ::
  Display icons beside completion suggestions.
- +tng ::
  Invoke completion on [[kbd:][TAB]]. When corfu is active, [[kbd:][TAB]] and [[kbd:][S-TAB]] will navigate
  the completion candidates. Arrow keys and evil-style movement are still
  supported.

** Packages
- [[doom-package:][corfu]]
- [[doom-package:][cape]]
- [[doom-package:][kind-icon]] if [[doom-module:][:completion corfu +icons]]
- [[doom-package:][corfu-terminal]] if [[doom-module:][:os tty]]
  
** Hacks
*** Snippet support
Since the [[doom-package:yasnippet]] is very tied to [[doom-package:company]] for
completion support, there isn't a proper capf for it. As such, we use
[[doom-package:cape]]'s adapter on the company backend to get snippet completion,
which works, but ideally we'd want something that doesn't pull in company. This
could be a new package implementing a capf interface to yasnippet, a
[[doom-package:tempel]] module, or maybe something else entirely.

* Installation
Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.

This module has no direct requirements, but some languages may have their own
requirements to fulfill before you get code completion in them (and some
languages may lack code completion support altogether). Run ~$ doom doctor~ to
find out if you're missing any dependencies. Note that corfu may have support
for completions in languages that have no development intelligence, since it
supports generic, context insensitive candidates such as file names or recurring
words.

** Code completion
By default, completion gets triggered after typing 2 non-space consecutive
characters, or by means of the [[kbd:][C-SPC]] keybinding at any moment. While the popup
is visible, the following relevant keys are available:

| Keybind  | Description                                          |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][<down>]]   | Go to next candidate                                 |
| [[kbd:][<up>]]     | Go to previous candidate                             |
| [[kbd:][C-n]]      | Go to next candidate                                 |
| [[kbd:][C-p]]      | Go to previous candidate                             |
| [[kbd:][C-j]]      | (evil) Go to next candidate                          |
| [[kbd:][C-k]]      | (evil) Go to previous candidate                      |
| [[kbd:][C-<down>]] | Go to next doc line                                  |
| [[kbd:][C-<up>]]   | Go to previous doc line                              |
| [[kbd:][C-S-n]]    | Go to next doc line                                  |
| [[kbd:][C-S-p]]    | Go to previous doc line                              |
| [[kbd:][C-S-j]]    | (evil) Go to next doc line                           |
| [[kbd:][C-S-k]]    | (evil) Go to previous doc line                       |
| [[kbd:][C-h]]      | Toggle documentation (if available)                  |
| [[kbd:][s-<down>]] | Export to minibuffer (if [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]])        |
| [[kbd:][s-j]]      | (evil) Export to minibuffer (if [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]]) |
| [[kbd:][RET]]      | Insert candidate                                     |
| [[kbd:][C-SPC]]    | (when completing) Insert separator (see below)       |
| [[kbd:][C-SPC]]    | Complete (unless [[doom-module:][:completion corfu +tng]])             |

If you prefer a [[kbd:][TAB]]-centric completion style, enable the [[doom-module:][:completion corfu +tng]]
flag so that, instead, you trigger completion with [[kbd:][TAB]], getting the following
additional binds:

| Keybind | Description                                |
|---------+--------------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][TAB]]     | Complete                                   |
| [[kbd:][TAB]]     | (when completing) Go to next candidate     |
| [[kbd:][S-TAB]]   | (when completing) Go to previous candidate |

** Searching with multiple keywords
If the [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]] module is enabled, users can perform code completion
with multiple search keywords by use of space as separator. More information can
be found [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless#company][here]]. Pressing [[kdb:][C-SPC]] again while completing inserts a space as
separator. This allows searching with space-separated terms; each piece will
match individually and in any order, with smart casing. Pressing just [[kbd:][SPC]] acts
as normal and restarts completion, so that when typing sentences it doesn't try
to complete the whole sentence instead of just the word.

Without [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]], it still works, just not as intelligently, due to
the lack of orderless.

** Exporting to the minibuffer (requires [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]])
When using the [[doom-module:][:completion vertico]] module, which pulls in the [[doom-package:][consult]] package,
the entries shown in the completion popup can be exported to a consult
minibuffer, giving access to all the manipulations the vertico suite allows. For
instance, one could use this to export with [[doom-package:][embark]] via [[kbd:][C-c C-l]] and get a buffer
with all candidates.

** Ispell completion
Ispell completion is supported, so long as you point to the right ~.dic~ file in
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~. For selected text modes (see the configuration
section) it completes everywhere, for programming modes it can complete in
comments and strings.

* Configuration
A few variables may be set to change behavior of this module:

- +corfu-auto-delay ::
  Number of seconds till completion occurs automatically. Defaults to 0.1.
- +corfu-auto-prefix ::
  Number of characters till auto-completion starts to happen. Defaults to 2.
- +corfu-want-multi-component ::
  Sets whether orderless-style matching should be supported with space as a
  separator.
- +corfu-ispell-completion-modes ::
  Lists modes in which to add ~cape-ispell~ as a capf. These show be majorly
  text modes, else you will get lots of bad suggestions, since when this matches
  it interrupts the flow of candidate selection.
- +corfu-ispell-in-comments-and-strings ::
  Whether we should complete when point is inside a string or comment. If
  non-nil, works as in a text mode, else gives programming completions just like
  in the rest of the buffer.

Additionally, if you prefer to never stop completion on [[kbd:][SPC]], add the following
to your ~config.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map corfu-map
      :desc "insert separator" "C-SPC" #'corfu-insert-separator)
#+end_src
