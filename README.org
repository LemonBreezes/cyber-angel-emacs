#+title: Cyber Angel Emacs

[[./media/cyber-angel.jpg]]

This is my Emacs OS. I use it for everything. Here is a summary of my two favorite modules:

* EXWM: Emacs X Window Manager

EXWM is a window manager for Emacs. It allows you to use Emacs as a window
manager. Here are some features my EXWM module provides:

1. Full Evil mode (Vim) integration globally for every application.
2. Automatic management of non-floating applications into workspaces.

* Misc Applications

This module provides an entire suite of desktop applications written in Elisp,
mostly through Helm and Consult autocompletion interfaces. The current categories of applications are:

1. Games.

2. Eyecandy. So screensavers and the like.

3. System, applications for managing your computer and Emacs OS.

4. Music.

5. External, applications which interface with a single external service
   provider like LeetCode.

6. Standalone, are Elisp applications which do not communicate with any external
   service provider or many, so for example ~elfeed~ or ~alarm-clock~.

   If you have ideas for apps that should be added or removed from this module,
   feel free to open an issue!

* Custom Emacs Patches

I've also added a few custom patches to Emacs, which are available in the
~emacs-patches~ folder. These patches are:
1. ~use-comp-speed-3.patch~: Sets the default compilation speed to 3, which
   generates faster code than the default of 2.
2. ~use-custom-cflags-for-native-comp.patch~: Sets custom CFLAGS for native
   compilation. These flags are specific to my computer but they serve as a good
   example.
3. ~use-lexical-binding-everywhere.patch~: Enables lexical binding everywhere as
   the default in Emacs and disables checking of the ~-*- lexical-binding: t~
   header. I have fixed all Emacs packages in this config which previously broke
   with lexical binding.

Note, if you use any of these patches on your version of Emacs, you must ensure
bugs are reproducible in an unmodified version of Emacs before reporting them
upstream with ~M-x report-emacs-bug~.

* My custom fork of Doom Emacs

I am also maintaining my own fork of Doom Emacs where I pre-emptively merge
specific Doom Emacs PRs that I am currently using:

https://github.com/lemonbreezes/doomemacs

Note, if you use my version of Doom Emacs and want to report a bug upstream,
make sure it is reproducible in the ordinary Doom Emacs first or report it to my
fork's repository instead.

* Leader key bindings

These are the non-misc-applications leader keybindings for this Emacs config
that are in currently enabled modules.
