#+title: Cyber Angel Emacs

[[./media/cyber-angel.jpg]]

This is my Emacs OS. I use it for everything. Here is a summary of my two favorite modules:

** EXWM: Emacs X Window Manager

EXWM is a window manager for Emacs. It allows you to use Emacs as a window
manager. Here are some features my EXWM module provides:

1. Full Evil mode (Vim) integration globally for every application.
2. Automatic management of non-floating applications into workspaces.
3. Universal editing of text boxes with ~exwm-edit~.
4. Configuration for a notification daemon implemented in Elisp, ~ednc~. (Though I
   still prefer Dunst)
5. A launcher for my personal applications.

** Misc Applications

This module provides an entire suite of desktop applications written in Elisp,
mostly through Helm and Consult autocompletion interfaces. The current categories of applications are:

1. Games.

2. Eyecandy. So screensavers and the like.

3. System, applications for managing your computer and Emacs OS.

4. Music.

5. External, applications which interface with a single external service
   provider like LeetCode.

6. Standalone, are Elisp applications which do not communicate with any external
   service provider or many, so for example ~elfeed~ or ~alarm-clock~.

   If you have ideas for apps that should be added or removed from this module,
   feel free to open an issue!
