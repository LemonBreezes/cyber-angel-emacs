#+title: Cyber Angel Emacs

[[./media/cyber-angel.jpg]]

This is my Emacs OS. I use it for everything. Here is a summary of my two favorite modules:

* EXWM: Emacs X Window Manager

EXWM is a window manager for Emacs. It allows you to use Emacs as a window
manager. Here are some features my EXWM module provides:

1. Full Evil mode (Vim) integration globally for every application.
2. Automatic management of non-floating applications into workspaces.
3. Universal editing of text boxes with ~exwm-edit~.

* Misc Applications

This module provides an entire suite of desktop applications written in Elisp,
mostly through Helm and Consult autocompletion interfaces. The current categories of applications are:

1. Games.

2. Eyecandy. So screensavers and the like.

3. System, applications for managing your computer and Emacs OS.

4. Music.

5. External, applications which interface with a single external service
   provider like LeetCode.

6. Standalone, are Elisp applications which do not communicate with any external
   service provider or many, so for example ~elfeed~ or ~alarm-clock~.

   If you have ideas for apps that should be added or removed from this module,
   feel free to open an issue!

* Custom Emacs Patches

I've also added a few custom patches to Emacs, which are available in the
~emacs-patches~ folder. These patches are:
1. ~use-comp-speed-3.patch~: Sets the default compilation speed to 3, which
   generates faster code than the default of 2.
2. ~use-custom-cflags-for-native-comp.patch~: Sets custom CFLAGS for native
   compilation. These flags are specific to my computer but they serve as a good
   example.
3. ~use-lexical-binding-everywhere.patch~: Enables lexical binding everywhere as
   the default in Emacs and disables checking of the ~-*- lexical-binding: t~
   header. I have personally PR'd all Emacs packages in this config which break
   with lexical binding enabled.

* My custom fork of Doom Emacs

I am also maintaining my own fork of Doom Emacs where I pre-emptively merge
specific Doom Emacs PRs that I am currently using:

* Leader key bindings

These are the non-misc-applications leader keybindings for this Emacs config
that are in currently enabled modules.
